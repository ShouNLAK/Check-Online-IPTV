## Warning Before Use

Please note that this tool is a student project. While it may not match the efficiency of some professional-grade solutions, it delivers acceptable performance for enjoying IPTV. Designed exclusively for Windows, it leverages Command Prompt functionality.

**Input File Requirements:**
- **Channel Name:** Located after the final comma.
- **Resolution/Quality (Optional):** Any details enclosed between the last pair of parentheses `()`.

**Output:**
- The generated `output.m3u` file will include only the Channel Name, URL, and, when available, the Resolution or Quality.

## How It Works

1. **Internet Connectivity Check:**  
   The tool first verifies that an active internet connection is available, continuously scanning every second until connectivity is confirmed.

2. **File Handling:**  
   It opens the designated input file and counts the number of IPTV channels listed.

3. **URL Scanning:**  
   The program examines each channelâ€™s URL to determine its status.

4. **Curl Command Verification:**  
   By executing the `curl` command through CMD, each URL is given up to 15 seconds to respond. URLs returning a 2XX/3XX response or prompting a download are marked as **ACTIVE**; all others are designated as **INACTIVE/TIMEOUT**.

5. **Result Recording:**  
   Information for each channel is compiled to present a comprehensive scanning summary.

6. **Output Generation:**  
   Only channels confirmed as active are exported to the final `output.m3u` file.

7. **Duplicate Filtering:**  
   If duplicate channels (based on the same URL) are detected, the tool removes redundant entries, keeping only the channel with the most complete information.

## Optional Features

- **VLC Launch:**  
  Prompt the user to automatically launch the output file in VLC media player upon completion.

- **Processing Duration:**  
  Calculate and display the total time taken to complete the scan.

- **Visual Progress Indicator:**  
  A dynamic progress bar enhances the processing experience.

- **Customizable Timeout:**  
  Users can adjust the response timeout threshold (up to a maximum of 30 seconds) if needed.
